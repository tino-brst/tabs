### Lyrics

`[Verse]`  
When the war is over  
And we go back to everyday, everyday  
Will it be the same again  
When you've been turned inside out and outside in?  

`[Chorus]`  
Singing from the windows  
Shadow on the wall, the way they dance  
Not much of nothing  
And look at this fire burning bright  

`[Verse]`  
Look at how the children play  
None of us know what's to come tomorrow  
But I'm not going out today  
So dance with me like the time we've got is borrowed  

`[Chorus]`  
Singing from the windows  
Sirens in the dark, where are you going?  
Pretend that it's nothing  
But look at this fire burning wild  

`[Bridge]`  
Well this is how we keep holding on  
Every day, all day long  
But sometimes things just fall apart  
No matter how you try, they won't stop  

`[Chorus]`  
Singing from the windows  
Something outside and I don't know  

`[Verse]`  
When the storm is over  
Picking up the pieces of everyday  
Memories in picture frames  
Trying to put the inside out and the outside in  

`[Chorus]`  
Singing from the windows  
Walking down the hall, nowhere to go  
It'd be good to see you  
Suppose when it's all said and done  

`[Bridge]`  
This is how we keep holding on  
All the days, all day long  
But sometimes things just fall apart  
No matter how we try, they can't stop  

`[Chorus]`  
Singing from the windows  
Voices outside and no one knows  
Singing from the windows  
We'll get going again  

`[Ending]`
When the war is over
