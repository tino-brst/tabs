### Lyrics

`[Verse]`  
Dear Marie, tell me what it was I used to be  
Oh Dear Marie, tell me what it was I used to be  
And if you’re further up the road, can you show me what I still can’t see?  

`[Verse]`  
Remember me, I’m the boy you used to love when we were fifteen  
Remember me, I’m the boy you used to love when we were fifteen  
Now I wonder what you think, when you see me on the magazine  

`[Verse]`  
From time to time, I go looking for your photograph online  
From time to time, I go looking for your photograph online  
Some county judge in Ohio is all I ever find  

`[Verse]`  
Dear Marie, tell me do you still believe in me?  
Dear Marie, tell me do you still believe in me?  
Well I’ve got my dream, but you’ve got a family  
Yeah I’ve got that dream, but you’ve got yourself a family  
Yeah I’ve got that dream, but I guess it got away from me
